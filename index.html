    <em>"Environments are not passive wrappings, but are, rather, active processes which are invisible.
        The groundrules, pervasive structure, and over-all patterns of environments elude easy perception.
        Anti-environments, or counter situations made by artists, provide means of direct attention and enable us to see and understand more clearly.
        Humor as a system of communications and as a probe of our environment--of what's really going on--affords us
        our most appealing anti-environmental tool. It does not deal in theory, but in immediate
        experience, and is often the best guide to changing perceptions.‚Äù - The Medium is the Message
